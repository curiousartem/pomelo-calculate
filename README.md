# This is a Discord Pomelo calculator.
### âš  This will probably get archived soon due to Discord changing its rollout schedule and the Pomelo rollout reaching its end.
### Discord Pomelo is the internal name of the username change system.

This calculator will calculate when your account will be eligible for migrating to the new username system, that's it.

To run this calculator, you need Node.JS, recommended v16.x and up.
Then, just cd into the repository that you cloned (using `git clone https://github.com/curiousartem/pomelo-calculate`) and run:
```
node index.js
```

You will be asked three questions:
1. The month your [Discord] account was created
2. The year your [Discord] account was created
3. Whether you have Discord Nitro since and before March 1st.

After those questions are answered, you're done! The estimated time of when you'll get the username update rolled out to your account will then be displayed in the console. Good luck!
